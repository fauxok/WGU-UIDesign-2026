<h1>Cats Care</h1>
<hr>
<p>
  Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and are currently the second most popular domestic pet in the United States.
  While there are over 60 documented cat breeds, care and diet can vary between breeds.
  However, some practices are generally recommended for the well-being of cats regardless of breed.
</p>

<p><strong>Zero to Four Weeks</strong></p>
<p>
  It is important that the queen (a term used for a female cat that is pregnant or nursing) directly nurses her kittens if possible.
  Monitor each kitten’s growth closely to ensure steady progress.
</p>

<p>If a kitten is not gaining weight appropriately, a caretaker may need to provide supplemental feeding. Common reasons include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Competition for milk:</strong> Too many siblings competing for the queen’s milk</li>
  <li><strong>Gastrointestinal disease</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Environmental conditions:</strong> Extreme heat, cold, or unsanitary conditions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Four Weeks to One Year</strong></p>
<p>
  Kittens can begin transitioning to soft wet kitten food around three to four weeks of age.
  According to the ASPCA, kittens should consume approximately half to one cup of dry kitten food
  or six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day.
</p>

<p>
  If a kitten has difficulty eating dry food, adding a small amount of water can help soften it.
  Kitten-specific food provides the necessary nutrients for growth, energy, and overall wellness.
  Dietary needs may vary by breed, so consultation with a veterinarian is recommended.
</p>

<p><strong>One Year to Seven Years</strong></p>
<p>
  During this stage, kittens transition into adulthood and require fewer calories and nutrients.
  Activity levels and metabolism slow, making free-feeding less ideal.
</p>

<p>
  Instead of leaving food out all day, offer meals a few times daily.
  This feeding practice helps reduce the risk of obesity and other weight-related health conditions.
</p>

<p><strong>Seven Years and Older</strong></p>
<p>
  As cats age, their nutritional needs change.
  Senior cats should consume fewer fats and calories while increasing their intake of high-quality protein.
</p>

<p>
  When selecting cat food, look for products that specify a particular protein source (such as “salmon”)
  rather than general terms like “fish,” which often indicate lower-quality byproducts.
